  summary: "I have more than a year of experience working with children aged 2-5, over 5 years' experience in retail and customer service, and had two semesters of experience tutoring college students in various subjects. I aspire to become a teacher of young children because the teachers I met throughout my academic journey have not only acted as a guide for me, but also pushed me to become the lifelong learner that I see in myself now. I also hope to complete graduate studies and conduct field research.",
